# Beam.js
A Node.js implementation of the 2D esolang [Beam](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Beam)

The code has been modified from [this StackExchange post](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/57190), so a huge thanks to user [MickyT](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/31347/mickyt) for writing that.
